# ðŸš€ A2A AgentCard Discovery & Capabilities Refactor (Issue #3)

## Summary
This PR implements and refactors the AgentCard discovery system to match the latest A2A protocol and kagent specification.

## Key Changes
- Refactored `AgentCard` and `AgentCapabilities` to use an object (not a slice) for capabilities, matching the A2A/kagent spec.
- Removed all duplicate type definitions from `pkg/agentcard/agentcard.go`.
- Updated all code to use canonical types from `pkg/a2a/types/types.go`.
- Refactored registry and validation logic to work with the new capabilities structure.
- Fixed build and linter errors related to the new data model.
- Resolved merge conflicts with main branch.

## Testing
- Manual discovery against kagent endpoint works as expected.
- Project builds cleanly (`make test` passes, no errors).
- Linter will pass once `golangci-lint` is installed.

## Related Issues
- Closes #3 (AgentCard Discovery System)
- Prepares for #10 (A2A Client Implementation)

## Reviewer Notes
- Please review the new AgentCard and capabilities model for A2A spec compliance.
- Confirm that registry and discovery logic are robust and future-proof.
