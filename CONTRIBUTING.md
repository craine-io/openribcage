# Contributing to OpenRibcage

🎉 Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenRibcage! We're building the universal coordination layer for AI agent frameworks, and we need passionate developers, framework experts, and enterprise practitioners to make this vision a reality.

## 🎯 What We're Building

OpenRibcage enables natural coordination of AI agencies across heterogeneous frameworks through transparent, framework-agnostic abstraction. Whether you're coordinating kagent infrastructure agents with CrewAI business process agents, or orchestrating complex multi-framework workflows, OpenRibcage provides the universal translation layer that makes it all possible.

## 🤝 How You Can Contribute

### 🔌 Framework Adapter Development (Primary Need)
**Build bridges between OpenRibcage and agent frameworks**

We're actively seeking developers to build framework adapters for:
- **kagent** (Kubernetes-native agents) - *Priority #1*

- **CrewAI** (Role-based agent teams) - *Priority #3*
- **LangGraph** (Workflow orchestration) - *Priority #4*
- **Custom frameworks** (Your favorite agent system)

### 🏗️ Core Infrastructure Development
**Strengthen the universal coordination engine**

- Real-time agency coordination and streaming
- AAMI integration APIs and protocols
- Security and audit logging systems
- Performance optimization and scaling

### 🛡️ Security & Enterprise Features
**Build enterprise-grade security and compliance**

- Agent Gateway integration patterns
- Credential inheritance and access control
- Compliance framework support (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Security audit and penetration testing

### 📚 Documentation & Community
**Help others succeed with OpenRibcage**

- Security pattern documentation
- Community support and mentorship

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+** for core development
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Kubernetes cluster** (k3d recommended for development)
- Basic understanding of agent frameworks and distributed systems

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/craineboss/openribcage.git
cd openribcage

# Set up development environment
make setup-dev

# Run tests
make test

# Build the project
make build
```

> **Note**: Detailed setup instructions are coming as we develop the core infrastructure. For now, join our Discord for real-time setup assistance.

### Your First Contribution

1. **Join our Discord**: [https://discord.gg/craine-io](https://discord.gg/craine-io)
2. **Browse open issues**: Look for `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` labels
3. **Read the architecture docs**: Understand how OpenRibcage coordinates frameworks
4. **Pick a framework adapter**: Choose a framework you're passionate about
5. **Start small**: Begin with basic status monitoring before complex coordination

## 🔌 Framework Adapter Development Guide

### Adapter Interface

Every framework adapter implements the standard OpenRibcage interface:

```go
type FrameworkAdapter interface {
    // Framework metadata and capabilities
    GetFrameworkInfo() FrameworkInfo
    GetSupportedCapabilities() []Capability
    
    // Agency lifecycle management
    CreateAgency(config AgencyConfig) (*Agency, error)
    DeleteAgency(id string) error
    StartAgency(id string) error
    StopAgency(id string) error
    
    // Real-time monitoring and status
    GetAgencyStatus(id string) (*AgencyStatus, error)
    ListAgencies() ([]*Agency, error)
    StreamAgencyActivity(id string) (<-chan AgencyActivity, error)
    
    // Command execution and coordination
    ExecuteCommand(agencyID string, command Command) (*Result, error)
    GetCommandHistory(agencyID string) ([]*CommandExecution, error)
    
    // Health and diagnostics
    HealthCheck() error
    GetMetrics() Metrics
}
```

### Adapter Development Steps

1. **Study target framework**: Understand APIs, agent models, and coordination patterns
2. **Implement interface**: Start with basic lifecycle and status methods
3. **Add real-time features**: Implement activity streaming and monitoring
4. **Test integration**: Validate with OpenRibcage core and test scenarios
5. **Document patterns**: Create guides for your framework's specific patterns

### Framework-Specific Considerations
